# minicap.so Builder

Build minicap.so for MuMu player (which is android-32, x86_64)

I cannot find this file online so I just build one myself lol

Still doing some cleanup so don't expect to run this repo.

Todos:

- [ ] Remove all windows related path
- [ ] Clean up building process
- [ ] Write a better guide
